# Virtual Theremin
My new app to detect hand gestures and create music from those gestures.

## Idea
The project is about retrieving a live feed from your webcam / front camera, then using google's mediapipe to detect hands. 

When the thumb and index of the right hand are pinched together, the theremin produces sound based on the x and y pixel coordinates of your thumb and index finger with respect to the screen's resolution.

Higher pitches are towards the right edge of the screen, and lower pitches are towards the left edge.

With your left hand, you can control the loudness of the sound. Increase the volume by raising your left hand, and lower it by lowering the left hand.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
